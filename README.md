# c_12_SeparateBill

## DESCRIPTION

Suppose you are eating out at a restaurant with a friend and want to split the bill evenly. You may want to anticipate the amount you’ll owe before the bill arrives with tax added. In this problem, you’ll complete a function to calculate the amount each of you owes based on the bill amount, the tax, and the tip.

```bash
$ ./build/separatebill
Bill before tax and tip: 12.50
Sale Tax Percent: 8.875
Tip percent: 20
You will owe $8.17 each!
```

Your function should use the input parameters, bill, tax, and tip, to calculate the final amount. However, since these values are percentages, you’ll have to do some work to convert these to more appropriate formats to use for your calculation.

The tax should be added to the bill amount before calculating the tip. Finally, you will return exactly half of the full amount, including the bill amount, the tax and the tip.

## INSTALL LIBRARIES

The source code uses the cs50 library what you can download [HERE](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50).

To install the cs50 library follow the steps:

1. Open git bash terminal and change the current working directory to `src`:  
   > cd ./libsc50/src

2. Compile the cs50.c source into .o with:
   > gcc -c cs50.c -o cs50.o

3. Make the library archive:  
   > ar rcs libcs50.a cs50.o

4. Copy the `libcs50.a` file into your compiler's `lib` directory

5. Copy the `cs50.h` file into your compiler's `include` directory

## COMPILE AND RUN THE CODE

The code is written in C, the compiler used to generate the exe is: `gcc Rev10, Built by MSYS2 project 12.2.0`

Run the below code in terminal (git bash) to compile the source:

> gcc commandLineArgument.c -lcs50 -o ./build/commandLineArgument

To run the executable run the below code in terminal (git bash):

> ./build/commandLineArgument.exe
